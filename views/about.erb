          <p class="card-text">Hop on Hoops was founded on the idea that basketball brings people together. By connecting players, coaches, friends, and communities with their local streetball courts, we can change lives. Find, rank, promote, and share the best parks in your neighborhood, create or join pickup games, and connect with Portlands most passionate community.</p>
          <p class="card-text">Thereâ€™s a court for everyone, no matter your skill level, and all of our courts are free and open to the public.</p><br><br>
